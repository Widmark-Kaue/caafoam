# caafoam
Density based fully explicit OpenFOAM solvers for Computational Aeroacoustics.

-The solvers can be used within both OpenFOAM-v2.3.x and OpenFOAM-v2112.

-The folder "cylinder Re=150, M=0.2" contains configurations files to run
a case described in Sec. 4.1.1 of Ref.[1]. 

-To run the computation is important to use the proper thermophysicalProperties
file contained in constant folder (depending of OpenFOAM version).
